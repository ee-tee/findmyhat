<p>Reflect on the following questions in your readme file:</p>
<br>
<p>●  What did you like about this project?</p>
<p>
This was a fun project, I had a great time and learnt a lot when doing it. I could really feel the power and possibilities of programming, and I enjoyed the fact that I could insert creativity into the process.
</p>
<br>
<p>●  What did you struggle with in this project?</p>
<p>
This was my first time attempting a JavaScript project using Node.js and npm so things felt pretty overwhelming at the start. I had to do plenty of read ups and trial-and-error revisions to get the game application to look and function as I had envisioned.
</p>
<p>
As this was purely backend scripting from scratch, much care and precision were required to visualize the structure and process of the codes in my mind before I could type anything into the js file. For instance, I was initially stumped when I had multiple "hats" instead of only one "hat" generating all over my "field", only to realize that I had made a silly mistake by coding that portion into the for loop together with the "field" and "holes". Thankfully, things gradually fell into place the more I amended and worked on my script.
</p>
<br>
<p>●  What would make your experience with this assessment better?</p>
<p>
If I had more time, I would have wanted to add on bonus features to the game like a hell mode (e.g. 20x20 map) as a bonus round or increasing levels of difficulty each time the player cleared one map, or multiple items to pick up before reaching the end point. I was also trying to figure out if there was a solution to ensure that the random "holes" could spawn in a way that would not block the player's route and cause a dead end.
</p>
<p>
I guess these ideas can be my homework for the future. :P
